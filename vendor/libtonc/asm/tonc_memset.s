// === NOTES ===
@ * 20050924: Lower overhead for all; reduced i-count for u16 loops.
@ * These are 16/32bit memset and memcpy. The 32bit versions are in 
@   iwram for maximum effect and pretty much do what CpuFastSet does, 
@   except that it'll work for non multiples of 8 words too. Speed 
@   is as good as CpuFastSet, but with a little less overhead.
@ * The 16bit versions call the 32bit ones if possible and/or desirable. 
@   They are thumb/ROM functions but did them in asm anyway because 
@   GCC goes haywire with the use of registers resulting in a much
@   higher overhead (i.e., detrimental for low counts)
@ * Crossover with inline while(nn--) loops (not for(ii++), which are
@   much slower):
@		memset32: ~5
@		memset16: ~8
